CSV data is sometimes unreasonably large - I've had to deal with CSV files in the multiple gigabytes - and cannot
comfortably fit in memory. It's better to treat these cases as an iterator of sorts, which is kantan.csv's default
mode of operation.

Let's take the by now familiar cars example from
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values#Example), available in this project's resources:

```scala
val rawData: java.net.URL = getClass.getResource("/wikipedia.csv")
```

This is what this data looks like:

```scala
scala.io.Source.fromURL(rawData).mkString
// res0: String = """Year,Make,Model,Description,Price
// 1997,Ford,E350,"ac, abs, moon",3000.00
// 1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition""","",4900.00
// 1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition, Very Large""",,5000.00
// 1996,Jeep,Grand Cherokee,"MUST SELL!
// air, moon roof, loaded",4799.00"""
```

Our goal here is to parse this resource row by row. In order to do that, we must be able to decode each
row as a case class. This is exactly what we did in a [previous tutorial](rows_as_case_classes.html):

```scala
import kantan.csv._
import kantan.csv.ops._
import kantan.csv.generic._

case class Car(year: Int, make: String, model: String, desc: Option[String], price: Float)
```

Now that we have everything we need to decode the CSV data, here's how to turn it into something that is essentially
an iterator with a `close` method:

```scala
val iterator = rawData.asCsvReader[Car](rfc.withHeader)
// iterator: CsvReader[ReadResult[Car]] = kantan.codecs.resource.ResourceIterator$$anon$3@8d14b7a
```

[`asCsvReader`] is explained in some depths [here](rows_as_collections.html), but we're more interested in what we
can do with our [`CsvReader`].

The first, fairly important thing we can do is `close` it if we don't intend to read the whole thing. If we do,
however, it will happen automatically and needs not be done explicitly.

Other than that, it looks a lot like any other standard collection. And being an iterator, it's lazy: you can apply
multiple `filter` and `map` operations, and nothing will happen until each row is explicitly requested. For example:

```scala
val filtered = iterator.filter(_.exists(_.year >= 1997)).map(_.map(_.make))
// filtered: kantan.codecs.resource.ResourceIterator[Either[ReadError, String]] = kantan.codecs.resource.ResourceIterator$$anon$3@173149ef
```

At this point, no data has been parsed yet. We can now, say, take the first element:

```scala
filtered.next
// res1: Either[ReadError, String] = Right(value = "Ford")
```

And this will only read as much as it needs to decode that first row. You could iterate over huge CSV files this way
without loading more than one row at a time in memory.
