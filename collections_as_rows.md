CSV is often used to store rows of homogeneous data - each cell could be an `Int`, for instance. We'll see in this post
how kantan.csv supports this kind of scenario.

In kantan.csv, all CSV serialization is done through [`CsvWriter`], which you can think of as a highly specialised
version of [`Writer`]. One retrieves an instance of [`CsvWriter`] as follows:

```scala
import kantan.csv._
import kantan.csv.ops._

// File in which we'll be writing the CSV data.
val out = java.io.File.createTempFile("kantan.csv", "csv")

val writer = out.asCsvWriter[List[Int]](rfc.withHeader("Column 1", "Column 2", "Column 3"))
```

Note the type parameter to [`asCsvWriter`]: this is what the returned instance of [`CsvWriter`] will know to encode.
Since we're trying to write lists of integers, we requested a [`CsvWriter[List[Int]]`][`CsvWriter`], but we could have
requested any subtype of [`TraversableOnce`] of any primitive Scala type.

The value parameters are the column separator and optional header row.

Now that we have a [`CsvWriter`] that knows how to encode [`List[Int]`][`List`], we can just call its [`write`] method
repeatedly:

```scala
// Writes a couple of rows.
writer.write(List(0, 1, 2))
writer.write(List(3, 4, 5))

// Makes sure resources are freed.
writer.close()
```

Note that [`CsvWriter`] supports a fluent style of chaining operations (or, in less pretentious english, each [`write`]
returns the [`CsvWriter`] itself), which I could have used to simplify the above code. I feel that spelling things out
helps, though, especially the explicit call to [`close`] at the end.

Let's make sure that we got the expected output:

```scala
scala.io.Source.fromFile(out).mkString
// res3: String = """Column 1,Column 2,Column 3
// 0,1,2
// 3,4,5
// """
```
