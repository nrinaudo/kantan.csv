In a [previous post](collections_as_rows.html), we've seen how to encode collections as CSV rows. This is useful when
dealing with homogeneous data, but not so much when not all cells in a given row are of the same time. One way of
dealing with such situation is tuples.

Let's imagine that we have data composed of an `Int`, a `Float` and a `Boolean`, and that we need to turn that into
a CSV file.

The first step is to retrieve a [`CsvWriter`] instance on the desired file:

```scala
import kantan.csv._
import kantan.csv.ops._

// File in which we'll be writing the CSV data.
val out = java.io.File.createTempFile("kantan.csv", "csv")

val writer = out.asCsvWriter[(Int, Float, Boolean)](rfc.withHeader("Column 1", "Column 2", "Column 3"))
```

Note the type parameter to [`asCsvWriter`]: this is what the returned instance of [`CsvWriter`] will know to encode.
We're trying to write instances of `(Int, Float, Boolean)`, which is what we passed.

The value parameters are the column separator and optional header row.

Now that we have a [`CsvWriter`] that knows how to encode `(Int, Float, Boolean)`, we can just call its [`write`] method
repeatedly:

```scala
writer.write((0, 1F, false))
writer.write((3, 4F, true))
writer.close()
```

Note that [`CsvWriter`] supports a fluent style of chaining operations (or, in less pretentious english, each [`write`]
returns the [`CsvWriter`] itself), which I could have used to simplify the above code. I feel that spelling things out
helps, though, especially the explicit call to [`close`] at the end.

Let's make sure that we got the expected output:

```scala
scala.io.Source.fromFile(out).mkString
// res3: String = """Column 1,Column 2,Column 3
// 0,1.0,false
// 3,4.0,true
// """
```
